#The title of this activity
title: Favor run-time mechanisms to work with secrets and improve lifecycle management.

#Describe the benefit that is achieved by implementing this activity
benefit: Risk of leaking production secrets is reduced by limiting their use to run-time
  only and by regenerating regularly.

#A one sentence description of the activity
shortDescription: Use run-time solutions to minimize access to application secrets.
  Properly manage the secret lifecycle.

#A multi-paragraph description of the activity
longDescription: |
  Whereever possible, rely on on-demand solutions to manage access to the secrets required to execute the application. This is typically achieved by means of a vaulting solution with an query interface that can be used by the application based on a bootstrapping secret.

  Implement lifecycle management for production secrets, and ensure the generation of new secrets as much as possible, and for every application instance.

  Ensure that all access to secrets (both reading and writing) is audited and logged in a central infrastructure.
