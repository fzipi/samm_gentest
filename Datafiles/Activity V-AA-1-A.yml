#The title of this activity
title: Develop high-level application and infrastructure architecture views and assess
  for security-related functionality

#Describe the benefit that is achieved by implementing this activity
benefit: Developers understand the architecture, interfaces, and how to secure them.

#A one sentence description of the activity
shortDescription: Identify application and infrastructure architecture components

#A multi-paragraph description of the activity
longDescription: |
  Identify application and infrastructure architecture components. Create a simplified view of the overall architecture and list identified threats and key security objectives. Do this based on project artifacts such as high-level requirements and design documents, interviews with technical staff, or module-level review of the code base. Identify the infrastructure components. These are all the systems, components and libraries (including SDKs) that are not specific to the application, but provide direct support to use or manage the application(s) in the organisation. From the architecture view, analyze each component in terms of its accessibility of the interfaces from authorized users, anonymous users, operators, application-specific roles, etc. For each interface, note any security-related functionality and check the model for design-level consistency for how interfaces with similar access are secured. From the architecture view, verify that existing mechanisms cover the identified threats and key security objectives.
