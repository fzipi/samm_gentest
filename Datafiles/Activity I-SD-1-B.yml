#The title of this activity
title: Production secrets are encrypted and not handled by developers.

#Describe the benefit that is achieved by implementing this activity
benefit: Risk of leaking production secrets is reduced by
  introduction of basic protection measures.

#A one sentence description of the activity
shortDescription: Introduce basic protection measures to limit access
  to your production secrets.

#A multi-paragraph description of the activity
longDescription: |
  Version and protect configuration files just like source code. Developers should not have access to secrets or credentials for production environments. Have a mechanism in place for the production environment to securely add production secrets to configuration files and adequately protect them. This can for instance be achieved by encrypting the production secrets contained in the configuration files.

  Do not use production secrets in configuration files for development or testing environments, as such environments may have a significantly lower security posture. Similarly, do not keep secrets in configuration files stored in code repositories.

  Store sensitive credentials and secrets for production systems with encryption-at-rest at all times. Consider using a purpose-built tool/vault for this. Handle key management carefully so only personnel with responsibility for production deployments are able to access this data (the principle of least privilege).

  #Encrypt secrets at rest in configuration files during deployment. Manage keys so the application can access the secrets while running, but an attacker who obtains the configuration files alone cannot.
